## Alternative Opening (Problem/Solution Format):

**Problem**: Claude Code is amazing, but sometimes I want different behaviors:
- Sometimes I just want an *answer*, not for Claude to start implementing
- Sometimes I need bypass permissions mid-session without restarting

**Solution**: Two configuration tweaks that solve both issues permanently.

Here's what I built...

## Engagement Hooks to Add:

**At the end, add one of these questions:**

- "What's your most-used custom command or configuration?"
- "Anyone else find themselves wanting to just ask questions without Claude taking action?"
- "What other permission management tips do you have?"
- "Should I share my full `.claude/` config setup next?"

---

## Visual Elements to Consider:

**Before/After Comparison:**

❌ **Before**:
- Have to guess if Claude will modify files when asking questions
- Need to restart entire session to enable bypass permissions
- Lose conversation context on restarts

✅ **After**:
- `/question` guarantees read-only research mode
- Shift+Tab seamlessly switches to bypass mode
- Maintain context while changing modes
